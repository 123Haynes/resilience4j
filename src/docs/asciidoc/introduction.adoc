== Introduction

This library is a lightweight, easy-to-use fault tolerance library inspired by https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix[Netflix Hystrix], but designed solely for Java 8 and functional programming. The library provides several higher-order functions to decorate any `Supplier / Runnable / Function` or `CheckedSupplier / CheckedRunnable / CheckedFunction` with a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html[Circuit Breaker]. In the following I call the higher-order functions decorators. The decorators return an enhanced version of your function. Furthermore, the library provides a decorator to retry failed functions. You can stack more than one decorator on any given function. That means, you can combine a Retry decorator with a CircuitBreaker decorator. Any decorated function can be invoked synchronously or asynchronously. The project uses a functional library for Java 8 called https://github.com/javaslang/javaslang[Javaslang].

The CircuitBreaker is implemented via a finite state machine with three states: `CLOSED`, `OPEN` and `HALF_OPEN`.

The CircuitBreaker does not know anything about the backend's state by itself, but uses the information provided by the decorators via `CircuitBreaker::recordSuccess()` and `CircuitBreaker::recordFailure(throwable)`. See example:

[source,java]
----
static <T> Supplier<T> decorateSupplier(Supplier<T> supplier, CircuitBreaker circuitBreaker){
    return () -> {
        circuitBreaker.isCallPermitted();
        try {
            T returnValue = supplier.get();
            circuitBreaker.recordSuccess();
            return returnValue;
        } catch (Exception exception) {
            circuitBreaker.recordFailure(exception);
            throw exception;
        }
    };
}
----

The state of the CircuitBreaker changes from `CLOSED` to `OPEN` when the failure rate is above a (configurable) threshold.
Then, all access to the backend is blocked for a (configurable) time duration. `CircuitBreaker::isCallPermitted()` throws a `CircuitBreakerOpenException`, if the CircuitBreaker is `OPEN`.

The CircuitBreaker stores the success / failure status of the calls in a Ring Bit Buffer. A successful call is a `0` bit and a failed call is a `1` bit. The Ring Bit Buffer has a (configurable) fixed-size. The Ring Bit Buffer uses internally a https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/BitSet.html[BitSet] to store the bits which is saving memory compared to a boolean array.

The Ring Bit Buffer must be full, before the failure rate can be calculated. 
For example, if the size of the Ring Buffer is 100, then at least 100 calls must be evaluated, before the failure rate can be calculated. If only 99 calls have been evaluated the CircuitBreaker will not trip open even if all 99 calls have failed.

After the time duration has elapsed, the CircuitBreaker state changes to `HALF_CLOSED` and allows calls to see if the backend is still unavailable or has become available again. The CircuitBreaker uses a new Ring Bit Buffer to evaluate the failure rate in the `HALF_CLOSED` state. If the failure rate is above the threshold, the state changes back to `OPEN`. If the failure rate is below the threshold, the state changes back to `CLOSED`.
`CircuitBreaker::recordFailure(exception)` also checks if the type of exception should be recored as a failure and increase the failure rate. You can configure the types of exceptions which should be recored as a failure. By default all types of exceptions are recored as failures.
