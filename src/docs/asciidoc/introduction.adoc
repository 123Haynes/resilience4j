== Introduction

This library is a lightweight, easy-to-use fault tolerance library inspired by https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix[Netflix Hystrix], but designed solely for Java 8 and functional programming. The library provides several higher-order functions to decorate any `Supplier / Runnable / Function` or `CheckedSupplier / CheckedRunnable / CheckedFunction` with a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html[Circuit Breaker]. In the following I call the higher-order functions decorators. The decorators return an enhanced version of your function. Furthermore, the library provides a decorator to retry failed functions. You can stack more than one decorator on any given function. That means, you can combine a Retry decorator with a CircuitBreaker decorator. Any decorated function can be invoked synchronously or asynchronously. The project uses a functional library for Java 8 called https://github.com/javaslang/javaslang[Javaslang].

The CircuitBreaker is implemented via a finite state machine with three states: `CLOSED`, `OPEN` and `HALF_OPEN`. The CircuitBreaker does not know anything about the backend's state by itself, but uses the information provided by the decorators via `CircuitBreaker::recordSuccess()` and `CircuitBreaker::recordFailure(throwable)`. The decorators are pure functions. The result of a decorator depends solely on the input parameters. See example:

[source,java]
----
static <T> Supplier<T> decorateSupplier(Supplier<T> supplier, CircuitBreaker circuitBreaker){
    return () -> {
        circuitBreaker.isCallPermitted();
        try {
            T returnValue = supplier.get();
            circuitBreaker.recordSuccess();
            return returnValue;
        } catch (Exception exception) {
            circuitBreaker.recordFailure(exception);
            throw exception;
        }
    };
}
----

The state of the CircuitBreaker changes from `CLOSED` to `OPEN` if a (configurable) number of call attempts have failed consecutively. Then, all access to the backend is blocked for a (configurable) time interval. `CircuitBreaker::isCallPermitted()` throws a `CircuitBreakerOpenException`, if the CircuitBreaker is `OPEN`.
After the time interval has elapsed, the CircuitBreaker state changes to `HALF_CLOSED` and allows calls to see if the backend is still unavailable or has become available again. On success or failure, the state changes back to `CLOSED` or `OPEN`, respectively. `CircuitBreaker::recordFailure(exception)` also checks if the type of exception should increase the number of failure attempts.
